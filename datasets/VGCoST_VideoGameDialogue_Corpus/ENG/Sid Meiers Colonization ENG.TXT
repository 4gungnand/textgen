@KINGGALLEON2
We are most pleased at the amount
of plunder and booty your conquistadores are obtaining
in the New World.  Alas, we notice that you do not have
a {galleon} fleet to transport this marvelous treasure home
to %STRING2.  If you wish, we shall transport the treasure

@KINGGALLEON3

in the New World.  We do not wish you to be distracted

home in our own royal galleons {for no extra charge} once our assessors have

from the Royal Treasury and {%NUMBER1} of our {Veteran Soldier} units to
assist you in carrying out your campaign.
If you wish, you may kiss our royal pinky ring."

you may kiss our royal pinky ring."

@ALREADYHAVE
The Church of England--theoretically a
Protestant denomination but maintaining many Catholic traditions--faced
a series of challenges during the colonial period from would-be
reformers, or {Puritans}.  The English monarchy shifted its support
between pro-Catholic and various Protestant factions from generation to
generation, and the English Civil War (1640-49) resulted in the execution
of Charles I and a period of Puritan rule (1649-60) under Oliver Cromwell.
With so much religious conflict at home, the English government had
neither the desire nor the ability to enforce religious conformity in
its colonial possessions.  The colonies became havens of
{religious freedom} for groups (e.g. Puritans, Anabaptists, Quakers) who
faced persecution in the Old World.
@NATION0B
Though French forts, missions, and trading posts soon dotted
the Great Lakes region, French settlements were generally small enough
to operate in relative {harmony} with the local native population.  Although
this relationship was not entirely without incident, the French were often
able to cooperate profitably with the natives.  This cooperation occasionally
extended into the military realm.
@NATION1B
This victory left Spain with
a generation of {military men} spoiling for a new avenue of expansion and
more eager than ever to bring Christianity to the {heathen} at the point
of a sword.  The New World and its unsuspecting natives provided exactly
such an opportunity, and the history of the first century of Spanish
expansion in America is the history of the conquest, plunder, and destruction
of countless Native American civilizations.  The Spanish were the first
Europeans to encounter the 'Indians,' and the otherwise mighty {Aztec}
and {Inca} empires proved psychologically unprepared for the arrival of an
alien power armed with muskets and thirsty for conquest.  Conquistador
{Hernan Cortes} arrived at Veracruz in 1519 with a few hundred men and,
within two years, brought the Aztec Empire to its knees.
@NATION2B
A maritime country of {fishermen}
and {merchants}, the Dutch Netherlands operated large merchant and fishing
fleets in the North Sea and the Baltic.  Upon achieving political
independence in the early seventeenth century, this tiny nation found itself
ideally poised to expand its {overseas trade} into lucrative new markets
in the Far East and New World.  Unlike their rivals and sometime enemies
the Spanish, French, and English, the Dutch were ruled by their merchant
class.  This unique arrangement led them to focus all aspects of state
diplomatic, military, and economic policy around the {interests of trade}.
Their strategy proved quite successful, and the Dutch economy
and merchant fleet expanded so rapidly that the other European powers felt
compelled to take drastic measures against the Dutch in order to prop up
their own less successful enterprises.
@NATION3B
{Commodity prices} in
Amsterdam {do not collapse} as quickly as in other European ports and

If you want to ask that the boycott be lifted, click on
the cargo type in question.
@KEEPSTOCKADE
If we navigate to the west ({left arrow}), we'll
probably find land.  If we sail to the east ({right arrow}), we can
return to port.
@TUTORIAL2
To put the colonists ashore,
move the ship toward land and choose {Make Landfall} from the menu.
@TUTORIAL3
To begin a colony, Sire, press the '{B}' key.
@TUTORIAL4
Our colonist is currently producing {%STRING0}.  He
could, for instance, produce {%STRING1} instead.  To change his job,
select him to bring up the {Jobs Menu}, then choose what you want him
to do.  You can also drag him to a different square, or into one of the
buildings in the colony.  To take a colonist out of a colony, drag him
to the fence (near the water on the colony picture).
@TUTORIAL5
If we send our ship there they will gladly
set sail with us and become useful members of our community.
@TUTORIAL6
If we move a ship
into %STRING1, we can pick up this cargo and take it back to %STRING2 in
Europe, where we can sell it for a profit.
@TUTORIAL7
To build
something, we must first make one of our colonists a {Lumberjack}
and have him chop {Lumber} in a forested square.  Then, we make
a colonist a {Carpenter}, who makes buildings out of the lumber.
Finally, we tell the carpenter what to build.  We do this by clicking
on the blue 'Hammer' button at the lower right of the screen.  This
shows us what we are currently building, and allows us to change it
if we want.
@TUTORIAL8
If we move him into a
friendly native village, the indians may be willing to teach him a
new skill.
@TUTORIAL9
Our {pioneers} will build
roads in a square if you press the '{R}' key. If we build a road here,
our fur, lumber, ore, and silver production in this square will be
increased.  Our units also move faster when they are moving
along a road.
@TUTORIAL10
Our {pioneers} will plow
the fields in a square if you press the '{P}' key.  Plowing a square
increases its food, tobacco, cotton, and sugar production by one.
Plowing a {forest} square causes the forest to be {cleared}, making room
for more agriculture.
@TUTORIAL11
We can use
it to explore the uncharted vastness of the New World, to carry our cargo
home to %STRING1 for sale, and to bring new immigrants from Europe.  You
can move the ship normally with the arrow keys.  You can also send it to
the port of your choice by pressing the '{G}' key.
@TUTORIAL12
The blue boxes across the bottom of the screen list the
cargo available in our warehouse.  To load cargo onto the ship, use
the mouse to drag it from the warehouse into one of the ship's cargo
holds (the small boxes underneath the ship's picture).  Once the ship
is loaded, you can return to the main map (press '{ESC}').  Then, on
the ship's next turn, you can send it to Europe by pressing '{G}'.
@TUTORIAL13
They are
ready to look for a good place to build our first colony.  Try to look
for a spot where there will be plenty of food and other resources
available.  Also, our first colony should be built near the ocean so that
our ships can reach it.  Our pioneers are currently equipped
with {100 Tools}, which they can use to clear forests, plow fields,
and build roads.  If we want to make more pioneer units later, we will
need either to bring more Tools from Europe or to have our blacksmiths
manufacture them.

@TUTORIAL14
They can be used to attack our
enemies, if we run across any.  More importantly, they can be used
to protect our own colonies from harm.  Our soldiers are equipped
with {50 Muskets}.  If we want to make more soldier units later on, we
will need either to bring more Muskets from Europe or to have our
gunsmiths manufacture them.  Our soldiers will also become more powerful
if we equip them with {Horses}.
@TUTORIAL15
You can make
them citizens of {%STRING0} by clicking on the colony, and then dragging
the colonists from the "fence" to a field or building.
@TUTORIAL16
Each colonist eats {two} units of food per turn.  Food is
represented by the "corn" icon if you are not growing enough food
each turn to feed all of your colonists, some of the corn in the colonist
window will be covered with red "X"'es.  To grow more food, turn more of
your colonists into {farmers} or {fishermen}.  You can make individual
farmers more productive by having your pioneers {clear} forests and {plow}
fields.
@TUTORIAL17
You can recruit new immigrants by pressing the {Recruit}
or {Train} buttons.  When ships arrive in the harbor, their cargo can be
sold by dragging it from the cargo holds to the blue warehouses at the bottom
of the screen.  Cargo can also be purchased by dragging it from the warehouse
to a ship's holds.  In the warehouse boxes, the first number indicates the
{bidding} price which the port will pay for that type of cargo.  The second
indicates the {asking} price should you wish to buy that cargo.  To send a
ship back to the New World, click on it or drag it into the "Bound for
%STRING2" box.
@TUTORIAL18
Since
{%STRING0} costs {%NUMBER0$} per unit and we only have {%NUMBER1$} gold,
we cannot afford 100 units.  If you want to load or unload less than 100
units of cargo onto a ship, simply hold down the {SHIFT} key while you drag
the cargo with the mouse.  You will then be prompted to enter the number
of units you wish to buy.
@TUTORIAL19
Unlike other types of colonist,
converts cannot be educated in new skills.  On the other hand, converts
are better than ordinary colonists at farming, planting, fishing, and
mining.

A colony built here may have a lower potential

Economy: start1, 2, low, high, burden, rise, fall, attrition, volatility
Start 1, 2      = Starting cargo price (lowest/highest)
Low             = Lowest possible drift
High            = Highest possible drift
Burden          = Extra difference between ask & bid prices
                  (0 means ask is 1 higher than bid)
Rise            = Price rises at this traffic indicator
Fall            = Price falls at this traffic indicator
Attrition       = Amount added to traffic volume each turn
                  (represents ability of price to recover)

@ *** CARGO TYPES ***
@CARGO0
^{FOOD}
Food is one of the most valuable commodities your people
produce. The survival of your colonies depends upon it. The best
places to grow food are in {plains, grasslands, prairie, and savannah.}
Plowing the land also increases food yield. {Fishing} is an excellent
source of food, and {fisheries} are particularly productive.
^
{Each colonist working inside a colony eats 2 food every turn.}
@CARGO1
^{SUGAR}
Sugar is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Rum} by a {distiller} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Sugar grows most abundantly in Savannah, especially in Prime Sugar 
Land.}
@CARGO2
^{TOBACCO}
Tobacco is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit 
or converted into {Cigars} by a {tobacconist} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Tobacco grows most abundantly in Grassland, especially in Prime 
Tobacco Land.}

^{COTTON}
Cotton is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Cloth} by a {weaver} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Cotton grows most abundantly in Prairie, especially in Prime Cotton 
Land.}
@CARGO4
^{FURS}
Fur is abundant in the Americas and there is a hungry market for it 
in Europe. Your {fur traders} can convert furs into coats for an even 
greater profit. {Woodlands} of all sorts are good for trapping, but 
even better are {game and beaver} squares in colder climates. 
Additionally, a {road} in a forest square increases fur output.
^
{Fur is found most abundantly in all forested areas, but especially in 
colder terrains where there is Beaver.}
@CARGO5
^{LUMBER}
Lumber is one of the most valuable commodities you can produce. Your
{carpenters} need lumber to build {buildings, ships, artillery, and
fortifications.} Lumber is collected whenever your pioneers clear a
forested square or when you have lumberjacks working the forests.
^
{Woodland of all sorts is good for wood cutting, and roads in forests 
and Prime Timber increase lumber production.}
@CARGO6
^{ORE}
Ore is one of your most useful resources. It can be sold in Europe or 
converted into {tools} by your {blacksmiths.} Tools may then be changed 
into {guns,} by {gunsmiths.}
^
{Ore is found in hills, mountains, and swamps.} 
@CARGO7
^{SILVER}
Silver is one of the most valuable metals found in the New 
World. Silver can be mined from {mountain} squares, and some native 
civilizations have it in great quantity.
^
{Silver is found in mountains, but these abundant sources will soon run 
dry if mined.}
@CARGO8
^{HORSES}
Horses are useful for aiding travel in the New World. {Scouts and 
Dragoons} move significantly faster than do colonists on foot.  {Any 
colonist} may be mounted to create {scouts} and {any soldier} can be 
mounted to create {dragoons.}
^
{Horses can be obtained only in Europe,} but once brought over, they 
may be bred. If you have {two or more horses} in a colony and {extra food} 
stored in your warehouse, your colony will {produce more horses}. If you
construct stables, your horses will breed twice as fast.
@CARGO9
^{RUM}
Rum is the product of sugar processing in a distillery. It is usually of 
much greater monetary value than raw sugar.
^
{Any colonist working as a distiller can convert sugar into rum.}
@CARGO10
^{CIGARS}
Cigars are the product of tobacco processing in a tobacconist's house or 
shop. Cigars are usually of much greater monetary value than raw 
tobacco.
^
{Any colonist working as a tobacconist can convert tobacco into cigars.}
@CARGO11
^{CLOTH}
Cloth is the product of cotton processing in a weaver's house or shop. It 
is usually of much greater monetary value than raw cotton.
^
{Any colonist working as a weaver can convert cotton into cloth.}
@CARGO12
^{COATS}
Coats are made from fur in a fur trader's house or shop. They are 
usually of much greater monetary value than unprocessed pelts.
^
{Any colonist working as a fur trader can convert fur into coats.}
@CARGO13
^{TRADE GOODS}
Trade Goods can be obtained only in Europe or from other European 
settlements. These represent manufactured goods such as small tools, 
jewelry, and clothing, which the Indians may want to trade for. Most 
native tribes will gladly take trade goods, at least at first.
@CARGO14
^{TOOLS}
Tools are fundamental to successful colonial endeavors. You need tools to 
create {pioneers,} and only pioneers can {build roads, clear forests, and 
plow fields.} Additionally, tools are necessary to complete many 
{buildings} you construct inside your colonies. Finally, tools are 
converted into muskets by {gunsmiths.}
^
{Tools may be bought in Europe or manufactured by blacksmiths, who 
convert ore into tools.}
@CARGO15
^{MUSKETS}
Muskets are necessary for defense of your colonies and for building a 
substantial military force. You need muskets to create soldier
units. {Any colonist} may be given muskets to create {soldiers} and {any 
scout} may be given muskets to create {dragoons.} 
^
{Muskets may be purchased in Europe or manufactured at an armory, 
magazine, or arsenal.} Any colonist working as a gunsmith can convert 
tools into muskets.
@      *** UNIT TYPES ***
@UNIT0
^{COLONISTS}
These represent the various people that come to the New World. A single 
colonist in the game represents a number of people in real life, perhaps 
100-200. There are four general types of colonists, each with different 
capabilities: petty criminals, indentured servants, free colonists, and 
specialists. Any of these colonists can do any job available in the 
settlement, but the experts do their particular jobs very well.
^
Another type exists: Indian Converts. These represent Native Americans 
that join your settlements and become colonists. They're very effective at 
outdoors jobs, but are little suited for manufacturing.
@UNIT1
^{SOLDIERS}
Soldiers are created when you give a colonist {muskets.} A 
soldier may become a {veteran} as a result of winning battles or of 
education in a {college}. Additionally, {Expert soldiers (veterans)} may 
immigrate to the New World from Europe upon occasion, and may be hired 
from the {Royal University.} 
@UNIT2
^{PIONEERS}
Pioneer units are created when you give a colonist {tools.} 
Pioneers have several important functions: they {clear woods, plow 
fields, and build roads.} In general, {Hardy Pioneers} perform their tasks 
faster than ordinary colonists working as pioneers.
@UNIT3
^{MISSIONARIES}
A missionary may be created at any site where there is a {church or 
cathedral.} This may be on the {Docks of Europe} or in a colony where a 
church or cathedral has been built. Missionaries perform the following 
important special functions: {create missions in native settlements} to 
counteract Indian anger {denounce another European's mission} in a 
native settlement (which can result in the destruction of that mission), 
or {incite Indians to attack} another European power. {Jesuit 
Missionaries are particularly effective at these tasks.}
@UNIT4
^{DRAGOONS}
Dragoons are {soldiers mounted on horseback,} the colonial equivalent of 
cavalry. Any soldier may be converted into a dragoon if he is given horses. 
Dragoons can move farther during a turn, and they fight more effectively. 
{Veteran dragoons are more effective in battle than normal mounted 
soldiers.}
@UNIT5
^{SCOUTS}
Any colonist can become a scout if he is mounted on {horses.} Scouts 
can perform many valuable services to your cause: they {reveal} 
unexplored terrain faster, {move farther} in a turn, have better luck 
when {exploring Lost City Rumors,} can meet with and {talk to Indian 
chiefs,} {infiltrate enemy colonies} to see what's going on, and meet with 
enemy mayors in their colonies. {Seasoned scouts are better at all these 
tasks than regular colonists working as scouts.}
@UNIT6
^{REGULARS}
European regular infantry units are the Crown's regular army troops. 
They enter the game against you if you declare independence. Their only
weakness is lack of training in the rough, wilderness terrain of the New 
World.
@UNIT7
^{CONTINENTAL CAVALRY}
Continental Cavalry is one step above your veteran dragoons in combat
effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veteran soldiers, and have 
received some military training.
@UNIT8
^{CAVALRY}
European regular cavalry units are the Crown's regular mounted soldiers. 
They enter the game against you if you declare independence. Their 
weakness is lack of training in the rough, wilderness terrain of the New 
World.

^{CONTINENTAL ARMY}
Continental Army infantry is one step above your veteran soldiers in 
combat effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veterans, and have 
received some regular  military training.
@UNIT10
^{TREASURE TRAIN}
This wagon train carries {plunder,} usually gold and silver, precious 
stones, and rare fabrics. Treasure trains are used to cart away the 
plunder gleaned from a native settlement or lost city. A {Galleon} is 
always required to transport the contents of a treasure train by sea.
@UNIT11
^{ARTILLERY}
Artillery may be bought in {Europe} or constructed by the armories 
within your colonies. Artillery is very effective at {attacking and 
defending colonies,} and also at attacking fortified units and Indian 
settlements. However, when defending in unprotected terrain it is 
extremely vulnerable, and when attacking there it is ineffective. An 
artillery unit that is defeated in battle is damaged and loses some of its 
firepower if defeated again, it is destroyed.
@UNIT12
^{WAGON TRAIN}
Wagon Trains are used for hauling goods and commodities {over land.} In 
order to trade most profitably with the Indians you should enter their 
settlements with wagons full of goods. A wagon train can transport any 
cargo a ship can, except colonists and artillery. Wagons have 2 cargo 
holds and can be assigned to {trade routes.} You may never build more 
wagon trains than you have colonies.
@UNIT13
^{CARAVEL}
A Caravel is an exploration ship designed to carry a small crew 
and adequate cargo for a few months of provisions. 
@UNIT14
^{MERCHANTMAN}

carry cash commodities to port for trade. It is a little larger than a 
caravel with more sail. 
@UNIT15
^{GALLEON}
A Galleon is a large cargo vessel designed for long voyages and heavy 
transport. It is as large as a ship of the line, but not armed. 
@UNIT16
^{PRIVATEER}
A Privateer is a ship owned by an individual that has obtained a "Letter of 
Marque" from his government, giving him the "right" to prey upon 
foreign shipping. Privateers can be very dangerous to your commerce 
because they observe no code of international behavior the countries 
sponsoring them will likely claim no knowledge of their actions. 
@UNIT17
^{FRIGATE}
Frigates are dangerous gunships, capable of sinking or damaging 
enemy vessels.  
@UNIT18
^{MAN-O-WAR}
These powerful vessels appear in American waters when the War of 
Independence develops. Your mother country will send them against your 
forces, and, if foreign intervention occurs, you'll receive some to support 
your cause. They are heavily armed with cannon and capable of carrying 
large invasion forces or cargoes.
@UNIT19
^{BRAVES}
Braves are small groups of Native Americans. They represent Indians in 
their natural state, before receiving guns and horses from Europeans.
@UNIT20
^{ARMED BRAVES}
Native Americans become increasingly dangerous as they learn to use the 
deadly weapons of the Europeans. When a native tribe obtains guns from 
the Europeans, some braves will be armed with them. {This, combined 
with their knowledge of the wilderness, make them formidable opponents 
in the woods, hills, and mountains.}
@UNIT21
^{MOUNTED BRAVES}
Native American peoples did not have access to horses until the Spanish 
brought them in the late 15th century. In some cases, Indian culture 
changed considerably to incorporate the horse as a vital element. {Horses 
increase the mobility and combat power of the Indians.}
@UNIT22
^{MOUNTED WARRIORS}
Tribes that have horses and muskets are very dangerous. They are as good 
as any colonial dragoons -- even better when fighting in the wilderness.

{Expert silver miners are twice as productive as others.}
@JOB8
^{EXPERT FISHERMEN}
Fishing has long been a lucrative business in Europe, and many of your 
immigrants come with expertise in this area -- an understanding of the 
habits and habitats of fish. The best places to fish are along the coasts of 
the oceans and in the lakes.
^	
{In general the more land that borders the square in which a fisherman 
works, 
the more productive he is.}
^
{Expert fisherman are twice as productive as others.} 
@JOB9
^{EXPERT DISTILLERS}
The craft of transforming raw {sugar into rum} and other spirits is as old 
as civilization itself. Some of the immigrants that come to your shores 
will have knowledge of these techniques.
^
{An expert distiller is twice as productive as an ordinary colonist 
working as a distiller.}
@JOB10
^{MASTER TOBACCONISTS}
After observing the Indians smoking tobacco and learning the many 
nuances of pipe and cigar construction, a small industry has risen in 
Europe to take advantage of this new market. Tobacconists convert 
{tobacco into cigars.} Master tobacconists appear on the Docks in Europe 
or can be trained there.
^
{A master tobacconist is twice as productive as an ordinary colonist 
working as a tobacconist.}
@JOB11
^{MASTER WEAVERS}
Weaving is an age-old craft that dates back as far as human memory. 
Weavers convert cotton into cloth and appear in Europe as immigrants, or 
can be trained there.
^
{Master weavers are twice as productive as others at weaving cotton into 
cloth.}
@JOB12 
^{MASTER FUR TRADERS}
The abundance of fur in the New World has vitalized the fur industry in 
Europe, and many expert furriers are coming to the New World to make 
their fortunes. Fur traders convert furs into coats and you get expert fur 
traders from the docks, or you can train them.
^
{Master fur traders are twice as productive as other colonists working 
as traders converting fur into coats.}
@JOB13
^{EXPERT CARPENTERS}
The timberland of the New world provides the raw materials for a host of 
construction projects. A master carpenter is essential to the development 
of your colonial society. Master carpenters appear on the docks in Europe 
or can be trained there.
^
{They are twice as productive as an ordinary colonistS working as 
carpenters, 
converting lumber into buildings.}
@JOB14
^{EXPERT BLACKSMITHS}
Metal working is an essential ingredient to successful colonization. 
Blacksmiths can repair metal implements and create new ones. 
Blacksmiths transform {ore into tools.} Expert blacksmiths appear on the 
docks in Europe or can be trained there.
^
{Expert blacksmiths are twice as productive as ordinary colonists 
working as blacksmiths.}

The ability to arm your people with weapons is fundamental in your 
journey towards independence. Gunsmiths transform {tools into muskets.} 
Expert gunsmiths appear on the docks in Europe or can be trained there.
^
{They are twice as productive as an ordinary colonist working as a 
gunsmith.}
@JOB16
^{FIREBRAND PREACHERS}
Religious unrest in Europe is a catalyst for immigration to the New 
World and is increased by preachers in the new world. Preachers produce 
crosses, representing religious freedom in the New World. The more 
crosses produced in America, the faster immigrants flock to the docks in 
Europe.
^
{A firebrand preacher produces twice the number of crosses as another 
colonists preaching in a church or cathedral.}
@JOB17
^{ELDER STATESMEN}
Politicians are valuable members of your society, for they 
build your political infrastructure. Statesmen produce Liberty Bells, 
representing governmental sophistication and patriotic fervor. Elder 
statesmen can be trained in Europe or found on the docks there.
^
{Elder statesmen produce twice the number of Liberty Bells as ordinary 
colonists working as statesmen in the Town Hall.}

@JOB18
^{Student}
@JOB19
^{FREE COLONISTS}
Free Colonists are immigrants desiring to go to the New World as free 
men and women and willing to work for the good of their communities. 
Free colonists are productive in all spheres of work -- in the fields and 
in the cottages. Short of being specially trained in a trade, they are the 
most productive members of your society.
@JOB20
^{HARDY PIONEERS}
A special breed of men and women come to the new world and carve a 
civilization out of the wilderness. Your pioneers are the advance guard of 
your new society. They build the roads, clear the land, and plow the fields. 
A pioneer can be created by giving any colonist tools, but hardy pioneers 
can be found on the docks of Europe, or trained.
^
{Hardy pioneers perform all pioneer functions faster than ordinary 
colonists working as pioneers.}
@JOB21
^{VETERAN SOLDIERS}
Any colonist can become a soldier if given muskets, but only experience in 
combat or training can create veterans. Veterans of European wars 
occasionally immigrate and appear on the docks, or you can train them in 
the Royal University. Additionally soldiers that win battles eventually 
become veterans.
@JOB22
^{SEASONED SCOUTS}
Any colonists mounted on horses may act as scouts. They see farther, move 
faster, and have the ability to gather information about foreign 
settlements, including Indian towns and villages. Seasoned scouts do all the 
above more effectively and safely. Seasoned scouts sometimes appear as 
immigrants on the Docks in Europe. Other times, scouts become seasoned 
after visiting Indian settlements.
@JOB23
^{VETERAN DRAGOONS}
Until the rise of your Continental Army, your veteran dragoons are the 
best military units you have. Dragoons are like soldiers in all respects 
except they are mounted on horseback and are thus slightly more 
powerful. They attain veteran status, like soldiers, through training or 
experience.
@JOB24
{JESUIT MISSIONARIES}
^The Jesuits are zealous christians who will gladly enter the lands and 
villages of the natives, establish missions, and live among them to teach 
the ways of Christianity. They serve as ambassadors to the natives and can 
often convince them to go to war for your cause against rival Europeans. 
Their main function is to asuage the anger of the native tribes and create 
converts.
^
{Jesuit missionaries are much more effective at all missionary tasks than 
ordinary colonists that have been blessed as missionaries.}
@JOB25
^{INDENTURED SERVANTS}
Indentured Servants are people desiring to come to the New World but 
who cannot afford to pay their own way. They, accordingly, put 
themselves into bondage and agree to work off their passage in the New 
World. They, like petty criminals, are useful workers in the fields and 
mines, but are less productive than free colonists in manufacturing and 
processing jobs. But, through education or military experience, they can 
become free colonists.
@JOB26
^{PETTY CRIMINALS}
Petty Criminals have been ordered to the New World as punishment for 
their crimes. In general, criminals are the {least productive members of 
your communities.} They make good laborers but are almost totally 
ineffective in manufacturing or processing jobs. But, through education 
or military experience, they can become servants.
@JOB27
^{INDIAN CONVERTS}
Missionaries working among the native population are able to convince 
some of the Indians of the veracity of Christianity. These converts are 
good outdoorsmen -- good at all the outdoor professions. However, they 
are not well suited to manufacturing or processing jobs.

@BUILDING0
^{STOCKADE}
A stockade is a low wooden barricade made of poles, sharpened at the top, 
with loop holes for firing muskets, and crude inside shelves for gunners. 
^
The construction of a stockade around a settlement represents a 
significant effort from the community and is a symbol of a willingness to 
stay for a while. Construction of a stockade may be started when the 
colony is still quite small (population 3). Once the stockade is completed, 
the population of the colony may not voluntarily be reduced to less than 3.
^
{A unit defending a colony inside a stockade has its defense strength 
increased by 100%%.}
@BUILDING1
^{FORT}
A fort is a substantial improvement over the stockade and can be 
built when the {population reaches 4} and already has a stockade in place. 
The stockade is reinforced with metal braces, artillery is installed to 
cover exposed approaches, and substantial defensive planning is evident. A 
fort overlooking the ocean will slow the progress of foreign vessels and 
open fire on them if they venture too close.
^
{The defense strength of a unit defending a colony in a fort is increased 
by 150%%.}
@BUILDING2
^{FORTRESS}
A fortress is an upgraded fort that can be built when the {population of the 
colony reaches 8} and already has a fort in place. The stout wooden 
barricade is reinforced and, in critical spots, replaced by stone masonry. 
Embrasures now house the artillery, which is more extensively used. 
Well-planned, overlapping fields of fire characterize the exterior 
approaches. A fortress overlooking the ocean will slow the progress of 
foreign vessels and open fire on them if they venture too close.
^
{Units receive a 200%% defense bonus inside fortresses.}
@BUILDING3
^{ARMORY}
Your people can construct an armory, a metal-working facility which 
allows the steady construction of muskets out of tools.
^
{The armory allows your carpenters to make artillery units, and your 
gunsmiths to convert tools into muskets.}
@BUILDING4
^{MAGAZINE}
An armory can be upgraded into a magazine when the colony's population 
reaches 8.
^
{A magazine doubles the output of muskets if the required tools are 
available.}

A magazine can be upgraded into an arsenal when the colony's population 
is 8.
^
{An arsenal doubles the output of muskets, if the required tools are 
available.}
@BUILDING6
^{DOCKS}
Docks are the moorings and wharves necessary to process fish garnered 
from the various fishing beds and fisheries scattered along the coasts of 
the New World.
^
{Docks allow your colonists to work as fishermen in any ocean or lake 
square adjacent to the colony.}
@BUILDING7
^{DRYDOCKS}
Drydocks include facilities and equipment for repairing ships and boats 
that have been damaged in naval combat. There is a drydock in your 
mother country at all times, but your people can construct a drydock in 
any coastal colony which already contains docks and has a population of 6. 
Whenever a naval unit is damaged, it is placed automatically in the 
nearest drydock for repairs.
^
{The presence of drydocks in a colony enables that colony to repair
damaged ships, instead of having them returned to Europe.}
@BUILDING8
^{SHIPYARD}
Shipyards are facilities that contain all equipment necessary to build 
ships.
^
{The presence of a shipyard in a colony enables carpenters to construct 
ships.}
@BUILDING9
^{TOWN HALL}
A town hall is one of the first structures the founders put together. It 
provides a place where the colonists from the surrounding area can gather 
to discuss issues facing the community. This is the first inkling of 
colonial government. A colonist in the meeting house produces Liberty 
Bells, which represent growing nationalism and colonial government. An 
elder statesman in a meeting house produces many Liberty Bells.
@BUILDING10
^{TOWN HALL} 
@BUILDING11
^{COLONIAL ASSEMBLY}
@BUILDING12
^{SCHOOLHOUSE}
To begin educating your citizenry, you must build a schoolhouse. It can be 
built when your population is 4. {The schoolhouse allows the following 
specialists to teach their skills to other colonists:}

10.} It functions like a college, except:
^
{Three specialists may teach simultaneously, and the following additional 
skills may be taught:}
^ù Jesuit Missionary
^ù Firebrand Preacher
^ù Elder Statesman
@BUILDING15
^{WAREHOUSE}
Normally, the storage facilities in each of your colonies can hold up to 
100 of each cargo type. Your carpenters can construct a larger 
warehouse.
^
{A warehouse can hold up to 200 of each cargo type.}
@BUILDING16
^{WAREHOUSE EXPANSIONS}
Normally, a warehouse can hold up to 200 of each cargo type. Your 
carpenters can construct an expansion to the warehouse, which adds 
another 100 to the total capacity. A warehouse with an expansion looks 
exactly like the normal warehouse, but a "2" is superimposed on it.
@BUILDING17
^{STABLES}
Stables are built in a colony to {increase breeding of horses.} Once the 
stables are completed, {horse reproduction is doubled.}
@BUILDING18
^{CUSTOM HOUSE}
After {Peter Stuyvesant} has joined the Continental Congress, your 
carpenters may construct custom houses. A custom house serves as a 
permanent arrangement between the colony that constructs it and the 
mother country. {Once completed, you sell goods and commodities on a 
regular basis to Europe,} and the logistics are taken care of for you. 
You no longer have to load and unload cargo or move the ships.
^
{A custom house also allows trade with Europe to continue after the 
Rebellion has begun otherwise, access to European markets is closed.}
@BUILDING19
^{PRINTING PRESS}
Printing presses and newspapers provide a forum for public expression. 
This public forum can create a sense of community and brotherhood which 
generates feelings of patriotism within a colony.
^
{When the the printing press is completed, Liberty Bell production 
within the colony is increased by 50%%.} 
@BUILDING20
^{NEWSPAPER}
Newspapers provide a forum for public expression of concerns facing the 
people. This public forum can create a sense of community and 
brotherhood which generates feelings of patriotism within a colony.
^
{When the the newspaper is completed, Liberty Bell production within 
the colony is increased by 100%%.}
@BUILDING21
^{WEAVER'S HOUSE}
A new strain of cotton is used by the Indians in America, and some 
colonists work with it to weave a fine grade of cloth. {A colonist working 
in the weaver's house can produce cloth} if there is cotton available to 
work with. Any cloth produced accumulates in the warehouse.
@BUILDING22
^{WEAVER'S SHOP}
A weaver's shop in a colony {increases the output of cloth by any 
weavers}. The colony must have a {population of at least 4} to begin 
construction of a weaver's shop.
@BUILDING23
^{TEXTILE MILL}
A weaver's shop may be upgraded into a textile mill. A textile mill 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations and thus produces 
{more cloth per unit of cotton.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.
@BUILDING24
^{TOBACCONIST'S HOUSE}
Some of the colonists have discovered tobacco from the natives and are 
already learning how to cure and dry the weed and to make cigars from it. 
Someday, this crop may grow into a major industry.
^
{A colonist working in the tobacconist's house can produce cigars if there 
is tobacco available.} Any cigars produced accumulate in the warehouse.
@BUILDING25
^{TOBACCONIST'S SHOP}
A tobacconist's shop in a colony {increases the output of cigars} by any 
tobacconists. The colony must have a {population of at least 4 } to begin 
construction of a tobacconist's shop.
@BUILDING26
^{CIGAR FACTORY}
The tobacconist's shop may be upgraded into a cigar factory. A cigar 
factory dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus 
produces {more cigars per unit of tobacco.} Your Continental Congress 
must contain {Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at 
least 8} to begin construction of this facility.
@BUILDING27
^{RUM DISTILLER'S HOUSE}
In some areas, fine cane sugar can be cultivated some of the natives 
cultivate large fields of it. The colonists know that it can be processed to 
produce rum.
^
{A colonist in the distiller's house can produce rum if there 
is sugar on hand to work with.} The rum is bottled and stored in the 
warehouse.
@BUILDING28
^{RUM DISTILLERY}
A rum distillery in a colony {increases the output of rum} by any 
distillers. The colony must have a {population of at least 4} to begin 
construction of a distillery.
@BUILDING29
^{RUM FACTORY}
A distillery may be upgraded into a rum factory. A rum factory 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus produces 
{more rum per unit of sugar.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.
@BUILDING30
^{CAPITOL}
@BUILDING31
^{CAPITOL EXPANSION} 
@BUILDING32
^{FUR TRADER'S HOUSE}
One of the first things your colonists notice when they get to America is 
the incredible abundance of fur-bearing mammals and the tremendous 
use that some of the Indians make of these pelts. They also realized the 
profit that can be made from selling the fur or making clothing from it. 
^
{A colonist working in the fur trader's house can produce coats,} if there 
is fur available to work with. The coats will accumulate in the warehouse.
@BUILDING33
^{FUR TRADER'S SHOP}
A fur trader's shop in a colony {increases the output of coats} by any 
traders. The colony must have a {population of at least 4 } to begin 
construction of a fur trader's shop.
@BUILDING34
^{COAT FACTORY}
A fur trader's shop may be upgraded into a coat factory. A coat factory 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus produces 
{more coats per unit of fur.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.
@BUILDING35
^{CARPENTER'S SHOP}
The community builds a carpenter's shop because of the obvious need for 
constructing all sorts of items for the good of the community. A colonist 
working in a carpenter's shop {produces hammers,} which accumulate 
{to construct buildings} and structures in the settlement. Note, however, 
that the carpenter {needs lumber to create hammers.}
@BUILDING36
^{LUMBER MILL}
The humble carpenter's shop can be improved and upgraded to make those 
working there more effective. You may upgrade a carpenter's shop into 
a lumber mill when the {population of the colony reaches 3.} It {doubles 
the output of hammers} from any colonists working there (but requires 
an equal amount of lumber, of course).
@BUILDING37
^{CHURCH}
A church may be constructed almost immediately upon landing on the 
shores of the New World. The {population of a colony need only be 3.} This 
causes {increased cross production} instantly, but putting colonists to 
work in the new structure creates many more.
@BUILDING38
^{CATHEDRAL}
A church may be upgraded to a cathedral when the {population reaches 8,} 
dramatically {increasing the colony's cross production} and that of any 
colonists preaching there.
@BUILDING39
^{BLACKSMITH'S HOUSE}
The Colonial community helps build the blacksmith's house for much the 
same reasons as the carpenter's shop. They realize the need for basic 
metal goods -- tools, repairs of existing implements, and so on. {A 
colonist working in the blacksmith shop can produce tools,} which 
accumulate in the settlement's warehouse. The blacksmith {needs ore} to 
produce tools.
@BUILDING40
^{BLACKSMITH'S SHOP}
A Blacksmith's House may be expanded into a larger facility that 
{increases the production of tools.} You may begin the project when the 
colony's {population reaches 4.}
@BUILDING41
