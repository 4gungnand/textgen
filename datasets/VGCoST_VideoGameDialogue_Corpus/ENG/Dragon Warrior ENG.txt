@DIALOGUE
‘To become strong enough to face future trials thou must first battle many foes.’
‘King Lorik will record thy deeds in his Imperial Scroll so thou may return to thy quest later.’
‘When the sun and rain meet, a Rainbow Bridge shall appear.’
‘Never does a brave person steal.’
‘There was a time when Brecconary was a paradise. Then the Dragonlord's minions came.’
‘Let us wish the warrior well!'
‘May the light be thy strength!'
‘If thy Hit Points are high enough, by all means, enter.’
‘We are merchants who have traveled much in this land. Many of our colleagues have been killed by servants of the Dragonlord.’
‘Rumor has it that entire towns have been destroyed by the Dragonlord's servants.’
‘Welcome to Tantegel Castle.’
‘In Garinham,look for the grave of Garin. Thou must push on a wall of darkness there.’
‘A word of advice.’
‘Save thy money for more expensive armor.’
‘Listen to what people say. It can be of great help.’
‘Beware the bridges!'
‘Danger grows when thou crosses.’
‘There is a town where magic keys can be purchased.’
‘Some say that Garin's grave is home to a Silver Harp.’
‘Enter where thou can.’
‘Welcome! Enter the shop and speak to its keeper across the desk.’
‘Thou art most welcome in Brecconary.’
‘Watch thy Hit Points when in the Poisonous Marsh.’

‘Rimuldar is the place to buy keys.’
‘Hast thou seen Nester? I think he may need help.’
‘Dreadful is the South Island.’
‘Great strength and skill and wit only will bring thee back from that place.’
‘Golem is afraid of the music of the flute, so ﾟtis said.’
‘This is the village of Kol.’
‘In legends it is said that fairies know how to put Golem to sleep.’
‘The harp attracts enemies. Stay away from the grave in Garinham.’
‘I'm too busy. Ask the other guard.’
‘I suggest making a map if thy path leads into the darkness.’
‘Once there was a town called Hauksness far to the south,but I do not know if it still exists.’
‘I hate people! Go! Leave me!'
‘They say that Erdrick's armor was hidden long ago.’
‘Many believe that Princess Gwaelin is hidden away in a cave.’
‘I have heard of one named Nester. Dost thou know such a one?'
‘Garin, a wandering minstrel of legendary fame, is said to have built this town.’
‘Welcome to Garinham. May thy stay be a peaceful one.’
‘It is said that the Princess was kidnapped and taken eastward.’
‘Come buy my radishes! They are fresh and cheap. Buy thy radishes today!'
‘To learn how proof may be obtained that thy ancestor was the great Erdrick, see a man in this very town.’
‘ﾟTis said that Erdrick's sword could cleave steel.’
‘Welcome to Cantlin, the castle town.’
‘What shall I get for thy dinner?'
‘I know nothing.’
‘I'm Nester. Hey, where am I? No, don't tell me!'
‘Grandfather used to say that his friend, Wynn, had buried something of great value at the foot of a tree behind his shop.’
‘It is said that many have held Erdrick's armor.’
‘The last to have it was a fellow named Wynn.’
‘My Grandfather Wynn once had a shop on the east side of Hauksness.’
‘Welcome!'
‘Who art thou? Leave at once or I will call my friends.’
‘I am Orwick, and I am waiting for my girl friend.’
‘The scales of the Dragonlord are as hard as steel.’

‘Thou shalt find the Stones of Sunlight in Tantegel Castle, if thou has not found them yet.’
‘Welcome to the town of Rimuldar.’
‘No, I have no tomatoes. I have no tomatoes today.’
‘You are [HERO]? It has been long since last we met.’
‘Good day,I am Howard. Four steps south of the bath in Kol thou shalt find a magic item.’
‘Before long the enemy will arrive.’
‘Heed my warning! Travel not to the south for there the monsters are fierce and terrible.’

‘Dost thou still wish to go on?' 
‘This is a magic place. Hast thou found a magic temple?' 
‘When entering the cave, take with thee a torch.’
‘Go to the town of Cantlin.’
‘I have heard that powerful enemies live there.’
‘Thou art truly brave.’
‘In this temple do the sun and rain meet.’
‘Howard had it, but he went to Rimuldar and never returned.’
‘To the south, I believe, there is a town called Rimuldar.’
‘That is good.’ ‘No one will say thou art afraid.’
‘Go to the south.’
‘Where oh where can I find Princess Gwaelin?'
‘Thank you for saving the Princess.’
‘Oh, my dearest Gwaelin!' ‘I hate thee, [HERO].’
‘Tell King Lorik that the search for his daughter hath failed.’
‘I am almost gone....'
‘Who touches me?' ‘I see nothing, nor can I hear.’
‘Dost thou know about Princess Gwaelin?' 
‘Half a year now hath passed since the Princess was kidnapped by the enemy.’ Never does the King speak of it, but he must be suffering much.
‘[HERO], please save the Princess.’
‘Oh, brave [HERO].’
‘I have been waiting long for one such as thee.’
‘Thou hast no business here. Go away.’
‘If thou art cursed, come again.’
‘I will free thee from thy curse.’
‘Now, go.’
‘Though thou art as brave as thy ancestor, [HERO], thou cannot defeat the great Dragonlord with such weapons.’
‘Thou shouldst come here again.’
‘Finally thou hast obtained it, [HERO].’
‘Is that a wedding ring?' ‘Thou seems too young to be married.’
‘All true warriors wear a ring.’
‘[HERO]'s coming was foretold by legend. May the light shine upon this brave warrior.’
‘Thou may go and search.’
‘From Tantegel Castle travel 70 leagues to the south and 40 to the east.’
‘It's a legend.’
‘Thy bravery must be proven.’
‘Thus, I propose a test.’
‘There is a Silver Harp that beckons to the creatures of the Dragonlord.’
‘Bring this to me and I will reward thee with the Staff of Rain.’
‘Thou hast brought the harp. Good.’
‘In thy task thou hast failed. Alas, I fear thou art not the one Erdrick predicted would save us.’
‘Go now!'
‘Now the sun and rain shall meet and the Rainbow Drop passes to thy keeping.’
‘Thou art brave indeed to rescue me, [HERO].’
‘I am Gwaelin, daughter of Lorik.’
‘But thou must.’
Princess Gwaelin embraces thee. 
‘I'm so happy!'
‘Forever shall I be grateful for the gift of my daughter returned to her home, [HERO]. Accept my thanks.’
‘Now, Gwaelin, come to my side.’
Gwaelin then whispers: ‘Wait a moment,please. I would give a present to [HERO].’
‘Please accept my love, [HERO].’
‘And I would like to have something of thine--a token.’
‘Please give me thy [ITEM].’
‘Even when we two are parted by great distances, I shall be with thee.’
‘Farewell, [HERO].’
‘I love thee, [HERO].’ 
‘Dost thou love me, [HERO]?' 
‘When thou art finished preparing for thy departure, please see me. I shall wait.’
‘I am greatly pleased that thou hast returned, [HERO].’
‘Before reaching thy next level of experience thou must gain [EXP].’
‘If thou dies I can bring thee back for another attempt without loss of thy deeds to date.’
‘Goodbye now, [HERO]. Take care and tempt not the Fates.’
‘Will thou take me to the castle?' 
‘Take the Treasure Chest.’
‘Welcome, [HERO]. I am the Dragonlord--King of Kings.’
‘I give thee now a chance to share this world and to rule half of it if thou will now stand beside me.’
‘What sayest thou? Will the great warrior stand with me?' 
‘What sayest thou? Will the great warrior stand with me?' 
‘Then half of this world is thine, half of the darkness, and....'
Thy journey is over. Take now a long, long rest. Hahahaha....
‘If thou hast collected all the Treasure Chests, a key will be found.’
‘Once used, the key will disappear, but the door will be open and thou may pass through.’
‘East of this castle is a town where armor, weapons, and many other items may be purchased.’
‘Return to the Inn for a rest if thou art wounded in battle, [HERO].’
‘Sleep heals all.’
‘Descendant of Erdrick, listen now to my words.’
‘It is told that in ages past Erdrick fought demons with a Ball of Light.’
‘Then came the Dragonlord who stole the precious globe and hid it in the darkness.’
‘Now, [HERO], thou must help us recover the Ball of Light and restore peace to our land.’
‘The Dragonlord must be defeated.’
‘Take now whatever thou may find in these Treasure Chests to aid thee in thy quest.’
‘Then speak with the guards, for they have much knowledge that may aid thee.’
‘May the light shine upon thee, [HERO].’
 ‘I am Erdrick and thou art my descendant.’
 ‘Three items were needed to reach the Isle of Dragons, which is south of Brecconary.’
 ‘I gathered these items, reached the island, and there defeated a creature of great evil.’
 ‘Now I have entrusted the three items to three worthy keepers.’
 ‘Their descendants will protect the items until thy quest leads thee to seek them out.’
 ‘When a new evil arises, find the three items, then fight!'
‘[HERO]? This is Gwaelin. Know that thou hath reached the final level.’
‘Death should not have taken thee, [HERO].’
‘I will give thee another chance.’
‘To reach the next level, thy Experience must increase by [AMOUNT].’
‘Now, go, [HERO]!'
‘Thou hast failed and thou art cursed.’
‘Leave at once!'
‘....'
‘Really?' 
‘I am glad thou hast returned. All our hopes are riding on thee.’
‘See me again when thy level has increased.’
‘Will thou tell me now of thy deeds so they won't be forgotten?' 
‘Thy deeds have been recorded on the Imperial Scrolls of Honor.’
‘Dost thou wish to continue thy quest?' 
‘Rest then for awhile.’
‘Go [HERO]!'

@ENDING SEQUENCE
‘The legends have proven true.’
‘Thou art indeed of the line of Erdrick.’
‘It is thy right to rule over this land.’
‘I cannot,' said [HERO]
‘If ever I am to rule a country, it must be a land that I myself find.’
Gwaelin said: ‘Please, wait.’ 
‘I wish to go with thee on thy journey.’
‘May I travel as thy companion?' 
‘Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live [HERO]!' 
‘Thou hast brought us peace, again.’
‘Come now, King Lorik awaits.’
And thus the tale comes to an end.... unless the dragons return again. 
CONGRATULATIONS
THOU HAST RESTORED PEACE UNTO THE WORLD
BUT THERE ARE MANY ROADS YET TO TRAVEL
